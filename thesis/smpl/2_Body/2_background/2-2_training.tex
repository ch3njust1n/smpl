\section{Training Deep Neural Networks}
\subsection{Training Theory}
\subsubsection{Gradient Descent}

\subsection{Distributed Training}
% Notes:
% 1. Problems with parameter synchronization
% 2. Proof that asynchronous training leaks information
%
% Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks for Decentralized Data paper
% Assumptions:
% - Fixed k clients and server must know they're participating before initiating training but they can drop out. Should compare this to SMPL which does not assume fixed clients
% - Assumes data is non-IID setting same as SMPL
